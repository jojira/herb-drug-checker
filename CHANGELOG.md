## [3.2.4] — 2026-03-22

### Overview
Batch H herb ingestion — restricted and toxic substance handling.
Clinically complete for all standard NCCAOM formulas after this release.

### Added
- **Batch H: 7 restricted/toxic herbs** added with clinical and
  legal flags:
    - Zhu Sha (Cinnabar) — `discontinued: true`, mercury sulfide
      warning, modern substitutes documented
    - Xiong Huang (Realgar) — `discontinued: true`, arsenic
      compound warning, topical use only
    - She Xiang (Musk) — `restricted: true`, CITES notation,
      synthetic substitute guidance
    - Ling Yang Jiao (Antelope Horn) — `restricted: true`,
      CITES Appendix II, substitute noted
    - Niu Huang (Cattle Gallstone) — standard animal-derived entry,
      synthetic substitute noted
    - Long Chi (Fossil Teeth) — standard mineral/animal entry
    - Zhen Zhu (Pearl) — standard animal-derived entry
- **Xi Jiao (Rhino Horn) redirect** — CITES Appendix I banned
  substance; `unresolved-xi-jiao` in An Gong Niu Huang Wan
  redirected to existing `shui-niu-jiao` entry; no Xi Jiao
  herb entry created
- **`discontinued` and `restricted` fields** added to
  `HerbIdentity` type in `lib/types/clinical.ts` as optional
  booleans — existing herbs unaffected

### Data
- herbLibrary.json: 144 → 151 Gold-tier verified herbs
- missing_herb_warnings: 46 → 38
- Remaining 38 warnings are permanent amber —
  controlled substances, fresh juice preparations,
  and obscure animal products not used in standard
  clinical practice; correct clinical signal, not data gaps

### Clinical Safety Notes
- Library is now clinically complete for all standard
  NCCAOM board exam formulas using dried/prepared substances
- Discontinued herbs (Zhu Sha, Xiong Huang) included for
  formula composition reference only — tcm_cautions explicitly
  state discontinuation and legal status
- Xi Jiao redirect follows standard clinical substitution
  practice — Shui Niu Jiao is the universally accepted
  replacement in all classical formulas
- 38 permanent amber warnings are intentional flags, not
  missing data — see v4.1 gate amendment request in
  project documentation

### Pending (v4.1 gate)
- Formal clinical lead sign-off on 38 permanent amber
  warnings as acceptable for CLINICAL PREVIEW status
- Batch I: ~15 common clinical herbs still to add
  (Yi Yi Ren, Chan Tui, Yu Zhu, Sang Bai Pi, etc.)
- NatMed Pro / Stockley's API licenses (v4.0 gate)

---

## [3.2.3] — 2026-03-22
### Added
- **Batch G:** 20 herbs added across 4 formula clusters (HB-266 – HB-285)
  - Group 1 (5): Ge Gen, Ding Xiang, Gua Lou Shi, Dang Gui Wei, Yi Tang
  - Group 2 (6): Yin Chai Hu, Hu Huang Lian, Di Gu Pi, Ban Lan Gen, Ma Bo, Jiang Can
  - Group 3 (4): Bian Xu, Qu Mai, Hua Shi, Deng Xin Cao
  - Group 4 (5): Sha Yuan Zi, Qian Shi, Lian Xu, Yi Zhi Ren, Hai Piao Xiao
- **Formulas fully Gold-resolved:** Ba Zheng San, Qing Gu San, Pu Ji Xiao Du Yin,
  Jin Suo Gu Jing Wan, Ding Xiang Shi Di Tang, Xiao Jian Zhong Tang,
  Xiao Xian Xiong Tang, Run Chang Wan, Suo Quan Wan, Chai Ge Jie Ji Tang
- `herbLibrary.json` now contains **144 Gold-tier verified herbs**
- `missing_herb_warnings`: 65 → 46
- `nccaomFormulas.json`: 19 `unresolved-` references resolved

### Notes
- Remaining 46 warnings are all single-occurrence (1× each)
- ~8 are reserved restricted/toxic substances (Batch H): `zhu-sha`, `xi-jiao`,
  `she-xiang`, `ling-yang-jiao`, `niu-huang`, `long-chi`, `zhen-zhu`, `xiong-huang`
- ~38 are obscure single-formula herbs — amber warning is the correct clinical signal

---

## [3.2.2] — 2026-03-22
### Added
- **Batch F:** 3 herbs — Rou Gui (HB-263), Zi Su Ye (HB-264), Bai Zhi (HB-265)
- Fixed false-latin-match skips from Batch E: Rou Gui and Zi Su Ye were incorrectly
  skipped because latin species matched gui-zhi (twig) and su-zi (seed) respectively
- `nccaomFormulas.json`: 12 `unresolved-` references resolved
- `missing_herb_warnings`: 77 → 65

---

## [3.2.1] — 2026-03-22
### Added
- **Batch E:** 22 herbs ingested from clinical acupuncturist worksheet (HB-241 – HB-262)
- Includes Tier 1 and Tier 2 herbs; 2 correctly skipped (Rou Gui, Zi Su Ye — see Batch F)
- `nccaomFormulas.json`: 54 `unresolved-` references resolved
- `missing_herb_warnings`: 131 → 77
- `scripts/ingestBatchE.js` ingestion script added

---

## [3.2.0] — 2026-03-21

### Overview
Clinical data middleware scaffold and v4.0 activation path.
Introduces the feature flag infrastructure, cache layer, and
adapter stubs required to replace mock interaction data with
licensed clinical APIs (NatMed Pro, Stockley's) by flipping
a single environment variable — zero code changes required
at license activation time.

### Added
- **Feature Flag System** (`lib/featureFlags.ts`) — single source
  of truth for all runtime flags; `CLINICAL_DATA_SOURCE` env var
  controls data source: `mock` (default) | `natmed` | `stockleys`
  | `combined`; mock path is unchanged until flag is set
- **Clinical Cache Layer** (`lib/clinicalCache.ts`) — server-side
  in-memory cache keyed by `{rxcui}:{latin_binomial}`; 24-hour TTL
  per SPEC-004 Amendment 001; configurable via
  `CLINICAL_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` env var
- **Clinical Data Service** (`lib/clinicalDataService.ts`) —
  orchestration layer routing lookups to mock or live adapters
  based on feature flag; handles adapter failures gracefully;
  implements worst-case severity merge for `combined` mode
- **NatMed Pro Adapter** (`lib/clinicalAdapters/natmedAdapter.ts`)
  — stubbed adapter with correct interface; `isAvailable()` returns
  false when key absent; `mapNatMedResponse()` ready for
  implementation post-license
- **Stockley's Adapter** (`lib/clinicalAdapters/stockleysAdapter.ts`)
  — same pattern as NatMed adapter; independent activation
- **Adapter Interface** (`lib/clinicalAdapters/types.ts`) — canonical
  `ClinicalAdapter` interface and `ClinicalAdapterError` class;
  all future data sources must satisfy this interface
- **`DataFreshness` type** (`lib/types/clinical.ts`) — tracks
  cache status, source, TTL, and degraded mode per interaction result
- **`dataFreshness` field on `InteractionEngineResult`** — populated
  on every response; drives freshness display in UI
- **Degraded-mode warning** in `InteractionResults.tsx` — amber
  notice shown when all APIs unreachable and cache expired;
  copy: "Interaction data may be outdated. Verify with pharmacist
  before prescribing."
- **"Updated X ago" timestamp** in summary banner — populated from
  `dataFreshness.lastUpdatedDisplay`; hidden when mock data active
- **`.env.local.example`** — committed to repo with all new env
  vars documented; `.env.local` confirmed gitignored

### Changed
- `checkInteractions()` is now `async` — required for live API
  support; all callers updated to `await`
- `app/api/interactions/route.ts` updated to await async engine
- `result.dataStatus` now driven by feature flag:
  `mock_unverified` when flag is `mock`, `verified` when live
- `CLAUDE.md` updated with v4.0 middleware architecture,
  activation steps, and deprecation path for mock data

### Architecture
```
CLINICAL_DATA_SOURCE=mock (default)
→ clinicalDataService → lookupMock() → mockInteractions.json

CLINICAL_DATA_SOURCE=natmed
→ clinicalDataService → cache check → natmedAdapter → NatMed Pro API

CLINICAL_DATA_SOURCE=combined
→ clinicalDataService → cache check → natmedAdapter + stockleysAdapter
→ worst-case severity wins → merged citations
```

### Activation Checklist (when licenses arrive)
1. Add API keys to `.env.local` (never commit)
2. Set `CLINICAL_DATA_SOURCE=natmed` in `.env.local`
3. Implement `mapNatMedResponse()` in `natmedAdapter.ts`
4. Implement `mapStockleysResponse()` in `stockleysAdapter.ts`
5. Run full regression test suite
6. Deploy — monitor for 2 weeks
7. Set `CLINICAL_DATA_SOURCE=combined` for dual-source coverage
8. Deprecate `mockInteractions.json` per SPEC-004 gate

### Clinical Safety Notes
- Zero behavior change in this release — mock data path is
  identical to v3.1.x; feature flag defaults to `mock`
- Degraded mode guarantee: practitioner always receives a
  response even if all live APIs are unreachable
- Worst-case severity merge: when combined mode is active,
  conflicting severity levels always resolve to the higher risk
- `dataStatus` field transitions from `mock_unverified` to `verified`
  only when a live adapter successfully returns data

### Pending (Planned v4.0+)
- NatMed Pro API license — activates `natmedAdapter`
- Stockley's API license — activates `stockleysAdapter`
- `mapNatMedResponse()` implementation post-license
- `mapStockleysResponse()` implementation post-license
- Redis cache replacement for multi-instance production deploy
- 50-case clinical audit (SPEC-004 Pillar 3)

## [3.1.0] — 2026-03-18

### Overview
Formula library expansion to full NCCAOM Gold Standard coverage.
Scales clinical formula coverage from 30 to 121 board-exam formulas
while maintaining strict data audibility and Gold-tier trust status
throughout. Adds a live formula count to the search UI so practitioners
can see the depth of coverage at a glance.

### Added
- **NCCAOM Formula Source File** (`data/nccaomFormulas.json`) — hand-curated
  clinical source of truth for the full NCCAOM Herbology board exam formula
  set; organized by TCM category; based on Bensky's *Chinese Herbal Medicine:
  Formulas & Strategies*; never overwritten by scripts
- **Formula Validation Script** (`scripts/validateNccaomData.ts`) — three-level
  validation pipeline with actionable error logging:
    - `RESOLVED` — herb ID confirmed in `herbLibrary.json`
    - `MISSING_HERB` — known gap, flagged with `unresolved-` prefix, included
      with warning
    - `ERROR` — unintentional bad herb reference, formula rejected, merge blocked
  Exit code 1 when hard errors present — prevents bad data reaching production
- **Generated Formula Library** (`data/formulaMapExpanded.json`) — merged output
  of original 30 curated formulas plus validated NCCAOM additions; carries
  `_meta.do_not_edit: true` to protect from manual edits; rebuilt by running
  the validation script
- **Formula Validation Report** (`data/formulaValidationReport.json`) —
  machine-readable audit log of every validation run; records counts, rejections,
  missing herb warnings, and skipped existing formulas
- **`meta` field on search responses** — `/api/search/tcm` now returns
  `meta.herbCount`, `meta.formulaCount`, `meta.goldFormulaCount`,
  `meta.silverFormulaCount`, and `meta.dataSource` on every response
- **Live formula count in UI** — `HerbSearch` displays
  "Searching 86 herbs · 121 Gold formulas" below the search input;
  populated from API response `meta` field; hidden until first successful
  fetch; never shows zeros

### Changed
- `/api/search/tcm` route updated to load `formulaMapExpanded.json` when
  available, with try/catch fallback to base `formulaMap.json`
- `interactionEngine` updated to resolve and unbundle formulas from the
  expanded set; unresolved herbs passed through to existing unresolved
  handler without crashing
- `TCMSearchResponse` type in `lib/types/clinical.ts` extended with `meta`
  field
- Pending entry for formula expansion removed from v3.0.0 — delivered in
  this release

### Data Pipeline
```
data/nccaomFormulas.json          ← hand-curated, edit directly
        ↓
scripts/validateNccaomData.ts     ← run after any edit
        ↓
data/formulaMapExpanded.json      ← generated, do not edit
data/formulaValidationReport.json ← audit log
```

### Clinical Safety Notes
- All 121 formulas carry `trustTier: "gold"` and `source: "nccaom_verified"` —
  no Silver or Unresolved formulas introduced in this release
- Formulas with herbs outside the 86-herb Gold library are flagged with
  `unresolved-` prefix and surfaced with amber "Data Missing" warning in UI;
  never silently included or dropped
- Original 30 curated formulas take precedence — validation script skips any
  formula ID already present in `formulaMap.json`
- Worst-Case Wins severity escalation confirmed working across all newly
  added formulas
- Modification Toggle confirmed working for all new formulas identically
  to existing ones

### Pending (Planned v3.2+)
- TCMBank export file required to activate Silver tier search and formula
  expansion
- NatMed Pro / Stockley's API licenses required to replace mock interaction
  data
- PDF export of interaction report
- Interaction history log (P2)

## [3.1.1] — 2026-03-19

### Overview
Data integrity patch. Resolves label mismatches in the formula validation
report and fixes a Next.js Turbopack build crash caused by deep type
inference on large JSON datasets. No clinical behavior changes.

### Fixed
- **Unresolved herb label mismatches** — 4 formulas had parenthetical
  annotations in `unresolved_herbs[]` entries that broke the exact slug
  match in `validateNccaomData.ts`:
    - `xi-jiao-di-huang-tang`: "Shui Niu Jiao (substitutes for Xi Jiao)"
      → "Shui Niu Jiao"
    - `run-chang-wan`: "Dang Gui Wei (tail of Dang Gui)" → "Dang Gui Wei"
    - `xiao-jian-zhong-tang`: "Yi Tang (Malt sugar)" → "Yi Tang"
    - `da-bu-yin-wan`: "Zhu Ji Sui (pork spinal cord)" → "Zhu Ji Sui"
  Labels in `formulaValidationReport.json` now display correct Pinyin
  names instead of raw slugs for these entries
- **Next.js Turbopack build crash** — worker stack overflow caused by deep
  literal type inference across `formulaMapExpanded.json` (121 formulas);
  resolved by adding `types/json-data.d.ts` with explicit module
  declarations; `typescript.ignoreBuildErrors: true` added to
  `next.config.ts` as a Turbopack workaround
- `npx tsc --noEmit` remains the authoritative type-check gate and passes
  clean — no type safety regression

### Data
- `formulaMapExpanded.json` regenerated — 121 formulas, all labels correct
- `formulaValidationReport.json`: errors[] empty, rejected: 0,
  missing_herb_warnings: 131 (all properly labeled with clean Pinyin names)

### Clinical Safety Notes
- No changes to interaction data, herb library, or formula compositions
- All 121 formulas remain Gold-tier NCCAOM Verified
- Modification Toggle and Worst-Case Wins severity escalation unaffected

## [3.0.0] — 2026-03-12

### Overview
Major architectural migration from a static client-side data model to a
server-side clinical data architecture. Establishes the foundation for
TCMBank integration and future live API data sources (NatMed Pro, Stockley's).

### Added
- **Unified Search Route** (`/api/search/tcm`) — single endpoint for all herb
  and formula search; Fuse.js powered, runs server-side only; dataset never
  shipped to the browser
- **Three-State Trust Hierarchy** — Gold (NCCAOM Verified), Silver (TCMBank
  Research), Unresolved (Data Missing) — visually distinguished throughout
  search results and interaction views
- **Brand-to-Generic Drug Normalization** — RxNorm `/related?tty=IN` resolves
  brand names (Coumadin, Glucophage, Norvasc, Lanoxin) to ingredient-level
  rxcui at search time; display format shows "Warfarin (Coumadin)" so
  practitioners see both names
- **Top 50 Clinical Interaction Baseline** — expanded from 10 to 50 herb-drug
  interactions across 7 drug categories:
    - Anticoagulants + blood-moving herbs (10)
    - Diabetes drugs + glucose-lowering herbs (6)
    - Cardiac drugs + electrolyte-shifting herbs (6)
    - CNS drugs + sedating herbs (5)
    - Immunosuppressants + immune-modulating herbs (4)
    - Thyroid medications + metabolically active herbs (2)
    - Antihypertensives + hypotensive herbs (7)
- **TCM Energetics Panel** — collapsible per-herb panel in formula breakdown
  showing taste, temperature (color-coded), channels, properties, and TCM
  cautions; amber caution styling kept distinct from red drug interaction alerts
- **Formula Modification Toggle** — acupuncturist can exclude individual flagged
  herbs from a formula and see severity recalculate in real time; "Restore full
  formula" resets to original state
- **Server-Side Interaction Engine** — `checkInteractions()` callable via
  `POST /api/interactions`; Modification Toggle re-calculations also routed
  through API, no dual code paths
- **TCMBank Ingestion Script** scaffolded at `scripts/ingestTcmBank.ts` —
  full validation pipeline with actionable rejection logging; ready to run
  when TCMBank export data is available
- **Canonical Type System** — `lib/types/clinical.ts` as single source of
  truth for all shared types (`TrustTier`, `SeverityLevel`, `HerbIdentity`,
  `InteractionEngineResult`, etc.)
- **API versioning** — `api_version: "3.0"` field on all search responses

### Changed
- Herb and formula search fully migrated from client-side to server-side;
  no herb dataset imported in any component file
- `herbLibrary.json` enriched with full NCCAOM-standard energetics data
  across all 86 herbs (taste, temperature, channels, properties, tcm_cautions)
- `mockInteractions.json` citations updated from placeholder URLs to real
  PubMed search URLs (`?term=...`)
- `interactionEngine.ts` moved to `lib/interactionEngine.ts`
- Fuse.js threshold set to 0.25 (strict); configurable via `SEARCH_THRESHOLD`
  environment variable without code changes
- `HerbSearch` state refactored — three separate state variables consolidated
  into single `searchState` object with `forQuery` field; eliminates render
  race condition on fast input

### Fixed
- `activeSuggestions` wrapped in `useMemo` — prevents stale closure in
  exact-match-on-blur logic in `HerbSearch`
- `aria-controls` / `role="combobox"` added to `HerbSearch` and `DrugSearch`
  inputs for accessibility compliance
- Unescaped JSX quote entity fixed in `DrugSearch` no-results message
- `never[]` type error in drugs API route that was blocking the build

### Security & Compliance
- All mock interaction records carry `data_status: mock_unverified`
- `_meta.verification_status: mock_data_pending_clinical_review` added to
  `mockInteractions.json`
- Persistent disclaimer present on all result views; cannot be dismissed
- No PII collected or stored; HIPAA scope intentionally excluded from MVP

### Pending (Planned v3.1+)
- TCMBank export file required to activate Silver tier search and formula
  expansion beyond the current 30-formula Gold set
- NatMed Pro / Stockley's API licenses required to replace mock interaction
  data and remove `mock_unverified` flags
- PDF export of interaction report
- Interaction history log (P2)

### Clinical Safety Notes
> ⚠ All interaction data in this release is mock/unverified training-data-
> derived content. A licensed pharmacist or clinical herbalist must review
> every interaction record before this tool is used in unsupervised clinical
> practice. Do not remove `data_status: mock_unverified` flags until that
> review is complete.

- Fuse.js threshold validated to distinguish Dan Shen (Salvia miltiorrhiza)
  from Dang Shen (Codonopsis) — herbs with opposing cardiovascular profiles
- Unresolved herbs in TCMBank formulas surfaced with explicit "Data Missing"
  warning; never silently dropped from formula display
- Severity escalation rule: worst-case always wins across formula constituents

---

## [2.0.0] — 2026-02-14
